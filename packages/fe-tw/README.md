This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [
`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically
optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use
the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme)
from the creators of Next.js.

## Pinata IPFS integration

If you want to utilise the part of functionality to upload JSON and images to Pinata IPFS, you need:

- Pass secret `PINATA_JWT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL` env variables taken from your Pinata account during the build
  time
- Have server side part of Next.js deployment enabled to serve upload API requests, see `packages/fe-tw/src/app/api` for
  more details.
