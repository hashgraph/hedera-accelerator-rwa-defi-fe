# 🏙️ Hedera RWA DeFi Accelerator – Frontend

Welcome to the frontend of the **Hedera RWA DeFi Accelerator** – a reference dApp for building, managing, and interacting with tokenized real estate assets on Web3. This is the user interface layer for a modular REIT system that models real estate as on-chain assets, designed with composability, investor accessibility, and DeFi integration in mind.

> 💡 This project is a **reference architecture** for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) on Hedera. It is not intended to run on mainnet or represent real financial instruments. 

---

## 📦 Features

This frontend is structured around the idea that **each building is a unique NFT-backed identity**, with attached metadata, tokenized ownership, and integrated DeFi flows.

- **🧱 Building NFTs (ERC-721 + Metadata)**
  - Unique NFT for each property with IPFS-backed metadata
  - Editable and freezable attributes (e.g. year built, COPE data)

- **💸 Tokenized Ownership (ERC-20 or ERC-3643)**
  - Regulated fungible tokens for shareholding
  - Geo and cap-based transfer restrictions

- **💰 Vaults (ERC-4626 & ERC-7540)**
  – Stake building token
  - Real yield and streaming revenue distribution
  - Async vaults for smoother high-volume DeFi integrations

- **🔁 Autocompounders**
  - Automatic reinvestment of yield
  - Growth of token holdings without manual claiming

- **🏛️ DAO Governance**
  - Proposals, voting, and treasury management
  - Multi-role controls for admin, investor, auditor

The frontend follows a modular structure built on **Next.js**:

```
app/                → Page routing
  └── admin/        → Admin tools
  └── building/     → Individual building views, interactions
  └── dash/         → Dashboard and analytics
  └── explorer/     → Browse buildings and slices
  └── slices/       → Slice management
components/         → All reusable UI elements
hooks/              → Web3 data hooks
services/           → IPFS, and contract interaction logic
consts/             → Token, building, slice constants
utils/              → Date helpers
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the following:

```
WALLETCONNECT_ID=
PINATA_API_KEY=
PINATA_API_SECRET=
HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet
```

You’ll also want your **Treasury account**, **Private key**, and **Contract addresses** (from the backend / deploy scripts).

### 3. Run the app

```
yarn dev
```

## 🧪 Testing

This repository uses Jest for testing:

```
yarn test
```

---

## 🔓 Connect Wallets

This app supports:
- MetaMask (for EVM-compatible accounts)
- HashPack (for native Hedera integration via WalletConnect)

Features like **building creation**, **governance updates** and **vault deposits** are available once authenticated.

---

## 📊 Key Workflows

### 🏢 Deploy a New Building
- Mint a building NFT with metadata URI and Building Token
- Create a vault, treasury and governance
- Add building to slices

### 📥 Add Revenue / 📤 Record Expenses
- Push USDC into building treasury
- Trigger real-yield distributions via vaults
